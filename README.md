# MODULES INVOLVED:
Components of a modern weather forecasting system
include the following modules: </br>
• Data Collection</br>
• Data Pre-processing</br>
• Training</br>
• Testing</br>
• Results/Output</br>


1.Data collection:</br>

In this step numerous sensors are used to collect the data
like wind sensors, rain sensor, pressure sensor and
temperature sensors. The data is collected repeatedly when
short interval of time so we’ve enough input for the process. Large dataset helps in increasing the accuracy of the output. After this the data is send for pre-processing.

2.Data pre-processing:</br>

The Pre-processing step is employed to remove the
unwanted data or noise recorded by the sensors during
transmission or it may refer to the selection of a pecific area
for consideration for prediction purpose. 

3.Training:</br>

Training of the network is done with the help of back
propagation algorithm. During this we’ve to choose learning
rate and therefore the momentum value. Learning rate
control the speed of the network. As we have a tendency to
increase the learning rate it’ll speed up the training. We are
using tan h activation function as a result of it provides more
recognition and accuracy. We can use any number of hidden
layers or can increase it if the network is not learning well. The input of the back propagation network is temperature, rainfall, humidity, pressure and precipitation.

4.Testing:</br>

Testing is completed by providing with numerous
different dataset as input and obtaining the specified result. When we don’t get correct results than the network is once
more trained. Network is checked with completely different
situations which will occur in future.
